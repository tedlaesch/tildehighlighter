# tildehighlighter README

A simple syntax highlighter vscode extension for the Program Translation Project language, which I like to call Tilde.

Colors may vary depending on your theme. Highlighting shows up well on vscode's dark mode with C/C++ theme and on Gruvbox Dark theme.

The highlighter uses regex to color symbols, variables, numbers, and if statements. Nested if statements should work as well, though the regex could probably be improved somewhat.

Hopefully this makes writing programs to test your projects easier!
